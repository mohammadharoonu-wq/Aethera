          <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            At ServeXservices, we take your privacy seriously. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, 
            use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you visit our website and use our services. 
            We are committed to maintaining the highest standards of data protection and compliance with 
            global privacy regulations, including GDPR (EU) and the Digital Personal Data Protection (DPDP) 
            Act (India).
          </p>

          <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
          <p>
            We collect information you voluntarily provide through our inquiry form, including:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Full name</li>
            <li>Email address (work/business)</li>
            <li>Phone number</li>
            <li>Service type and project brief</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            We do not collect sensitive personal data, financial information, or biometric data. 
            All data collection is transparent and purposeful.
          </p>

          <h2>3. Data Storage &amp; Encryption Standard</h2>
          <p>
            All personal data is stored exclusively in encrypted form using industry-standard 
            <strong> AES-256 encryption</strong>. Database fields are cryptographically protected 
            via hardware-backed key rings, preventing unauthorised local data read operations even 
            from compromised database access.
          </p>
          <p>
            Data is stored in secure, ISO 27001-aligned facilities. We never store passwords in plaintext 
            and use bcryptjs for all password hashing with salted iterations.
          </p>

          <h2>4. Data Usage &amp; Purpose</h2>
          <p>
            We use your personal data exclusively for:

            <li>Contacting you regarding your service request</li>
            <li>Improving our services and user experience</li>
            <li>Complying with legal obligations</li>

          </p>

          <h2>7. Confidentiality</h2>

          <p>
            <strong>Excluded Damages:</strong> In no event shall ServeXservices be liable for indirect,

          <p>
            This limitation applies regardless of the cause of action and even if advised of the 
            possibility of such damages.
          </p>

          <h2>9. Indemnification</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>By the Client:</strong> You agree to indemnify and hold harmless ServeXservices from any

          <p>
            <strong>Change Request Process:</strong> Any changes to the scope, timeline, or deliverables 
            defined in the SOW must be requested in writing and approved by both parties before execution.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Additional Costs:</strong> Out-of-scope changes typically incur additional fees. 
            ServeXservices will provide a revised estimate before proceeding with out-of-scope work.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Timeline Impact:</strong> Scope changes may extend the project timeline. Revised

          <h2>11. Refund &amp; Cancellation Policy</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>Deposit &amp; Prepayments:</strong> Project deposits and upfront milestone payments are generally 
            non-refundable once work has commenced, as they secure dedicated resources and team availability.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Early Termination by Client:</strong> If you terminate before project completion:

            <li>Partial refunds may apply for unused paid milestones if termination occurs before work begins</li>
            <li>The SOW will specify refund eligibility for each milestone</li>

          <p>
            <strong>Refund Process:</strong> Refund requests must be submitted in writing within 30 days of termination. 
            Approved refunds will be processed within 15 business days to the original payment method.

            <strong>No Refund Scenarios:</strong> No refunds are issued for:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Work already completed and accepted by client</li>
