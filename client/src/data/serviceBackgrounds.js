/**
 * Background artwork for the service cards, keyed by the slug the API already
 * returns — no new field on the Service model, so the admin CRUD form and the
 * migration both stay as they are.
 *
 * Imported rather than referenced by path so Vite fingerprints and bundles each
 * file; a bare "/assets/..." string would resolve at runtime and 404 in the
 * production build. An unmapped slug (a service added through the admin later)
 * simply gets no artwork, which is why every consumer must treat this lookup as
 * optional.
